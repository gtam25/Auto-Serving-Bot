        and this can be used to serve orders at the customer table. \n"
        "The robot also accommodates best features like find the shortest route to the counter while
        satisfying maximum number of customers en route, obstacle detection and collision avoidance,
        rerouting dynamically based on the dynamic nature of incoming requests.
        Multiple ASBs can also be used to improve customer service and share workloads among bots.
        The bots also communicate among themselves to provide best efficient service. The robots use white line following
        technique to reach counter or desired table and ZigBee for communication with each other and with the counter \n"
