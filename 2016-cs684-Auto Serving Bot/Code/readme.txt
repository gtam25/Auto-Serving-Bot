Project Description 
------------------- 
 
The Project aims to automate the process of serving orders in restaurant by using firebird V robot. We have successfully created an android application from which order can be placed by a customer and the order is served to his table by a firebird V robot.
The task was made more challenging by adding two more bots for serving and hence there was requirement of coordination among three bots to ensure proper delivery of orders and avoiding collisions and deadlocks. The same was achieved by using round robin scheduling algorithm for tasking bots and carefully designing onward and backward path from start point to destination and planning re-routing algorithms in real time to avoid collisions and deadlocks by using techniques similar to exponential backoff algorithm used for collision avoidance in computer networks using variable delays.
